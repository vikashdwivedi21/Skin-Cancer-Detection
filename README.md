# Skin Cancer Classification using CNN

This project aims to classify skin cancer images into different categories using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The model is trained on a dataset of skin cancer images and can predict the presence of skin cancer in new images.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Install the required dependencies.
sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook skin_cancer_classification.ipynb to train the CNN model and evaluate its performance.
Use the trained model to make predictions on new skin cancer images.
Dataset
The skin cancer dataset used for this project contains a collection of images categorized into different types of skin lesions. The dataset is not publicly available and must be obtained separately.

Creating a custom dataset by combining renowned datasets International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nodoubttome/skin-cancer9-classesisic), the HAM10000 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000), and the Skin Cancer Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/farjanakabirsamanta/skin-cancer-dataset) can result in the creation of an extensive and diverse repository of skin cancer images.  By merging these datasets, we can leverage the rich variety of skin lesion images from different sources, encompassing a broad spectrum of benign and malignant cases, facilitating the development of a robust and generalized skin cancer detection model. It is essential to ensure consistent labeling across the combined dataset, along with meticulous data preprocessing to standardize image formats and quality. Additionally, maintaining a balanced representation of various skin lesion types and considering ethical guidelines regarding data usage and privacy will be crucial throughout the dataset compilation process.
